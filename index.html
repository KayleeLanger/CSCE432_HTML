          Howdy, my name is Kaylee Langer and I am a Computer Engineering major in the
          Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2026! Besides showing school spirit by participating
          in various activities on campus such as attending football games, you can find me
          inside playing the newest trending video game. Here on my website you can find
          anything from my personal interests to my comprehensive resume and a more detailed
          look at my accomplishments. Please do not hesitate to contact me, whether that be
          with career opportunities or to discuss other topics!

      <h3>What I Bring to the Table</h3>
      <p>
        As a whole, I bring a unique combination of leadership, technical expertise, and
        problem-solving skills to the table. Through my role at Open Access Labs as Student
        Leader, I have learned to successfully lead teams to meet deadlines and exceed expectations.
        In addition to my strong leadership skills, I have greatly developed my technical skills as a
        whole as I progress through my rigorous degree plan. With a proven track record in delivering
        ahead of schedule and mentoring others, I’m eager to bring this drive for excellence to your team!
